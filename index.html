  <h1>Welcome to the Great Hall of Babel</h1>
  <p>
    You’ve entered a chamber of echoes and essence.
    Here, fragments of thought, ritual, and identity are distilled into single pages—each one a <em>snippet of me</em>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Take what resonates.<br>
    Leave what doesn’t.<br>
    Return as often as you need—the Machine is always listening.
